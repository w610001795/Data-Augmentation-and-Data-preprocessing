# Data-Augmentation-and-Data-preprocessing    
Python 2.7.12ï¼šSome samll tools of the preprocessing of DeepLearning to process and argument your dataset      
'.PNG' image is for example, others can also be done.
## findthemandmove.py
This program is designed to achieve data naming rules in the process of Deep Learning Data Preprocessing. It can find files which contain specified information (just your input) in batches and move them to the specified directory in batches.    
## number.py
It is so easy that this is just to number the number of one folder.This function has great demand, especially when large amounts of image data are preprocessed.
## Random_data.py
Randomly extract the specified number of data in the generated dataset and store it in the specified folder.
## data_rorate.py and rorate.py
These two files need to be put together and only running `data_rorate.py` is enough. Modify the parameters in `rorate.py` to enhance the data. Run `data_rorate.py` to separate the data randomly (training set and test set) and a progressbar is also convenient.
